 Week 2 Report


1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
   - Implemented pixel normalization (0-255 → 0-1)
   - Added a channel dimension for CNN compatibility
   - Created one-hot encoding for categorical labels
   - Established train-test split preservation

2. Baseline Model Development
   - Designed CNN architecture with 3 convolutional layers
   - Implemented proper regularization (Dropout 0.5)
   - Configured Adam optimizer with categorical cross entropy
   - Model summary: ~100K parameters

3. Baseline Training & Evaluation
   - Trained for 15 epochs with batch size 128
   - Achieved baseline performance:
     -   Test Accuracy: 91.45%
     -   Test Loss: 0.2578
   - Generated training history visualizations
   - Confirmed model convergence and no overfitting

4. Performance Benchmarking
   - Established baseline as a reference point
   - Verified a model suitability for compression experiments
   - Confirmed training stability across epochs
