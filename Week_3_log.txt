Week 3 Report


1. Compression Method Implementation
   - Random Subsampling: Simple random selection (10% of data)
   - Stratified Sampling: Class-balanced random selection
   - K-Center Greedy: Coreset selection using farthest-point sampling

2. Compression Application
   - Applied all three methods with 10% compression ratio
   - Resulting dataset sizes: ~6,000 samples each
   - Preserved data integrity and format compatibility

3. Compressed Data Analysis
   - Generated distribution visualizations for all methods
   - Verified stratified sampling maintains class proportions
   - Observed K-Center's diverse sample selection

4. Initial Compressed Model Training
   - Began training models on compressed datasets
   - Used identical architecture and hyperparameters as baseline
   - Implemented consistent evaluation metrics
