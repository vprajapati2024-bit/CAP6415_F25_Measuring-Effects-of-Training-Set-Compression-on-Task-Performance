Completed Tasks:
1. Project Setup & Repository Creation
   - Created GitHub repository with proper structure
   - Set up development environment with required libraries
   - Established project documentation and README

2. Problem Analysis & Requirements Gathering
   - Analyzed real-world e-commerce scenario
   - Defined project objectives: measure compression impact on classification accuracy
   - Identified constraints: mobile storage limitations, computational resources

3. Dataset Selection & Initial Exploration
   - Selected Fashion-MNIST as proxy for e-commerce product images
   - Loaded and explored dataset characteristics:
     - 60,000 training samples, 10,000 test samples
     - 10 product categories (T-shirts, trousers, dresses, etc.)
     - 28x28 grayscale images
   - Verified balanced class distribution

4. Initial Data Analysis
   - Generated sample image visualizations
   - Created label distribution charts
   - Confirmed dataset suitability for compression experiments
